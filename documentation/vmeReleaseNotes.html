<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is the first release of the synApps vme module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from software as previously released in std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>Converted to EPICS 3.14.
<li><p>VME_DAC_SETTINGS.req,  VME_DAC_POSITIONS.req - New files

</ul>
